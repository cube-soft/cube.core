The Cube.FileSystem.AlphaFS package uses the [AlphaFS](https://alphafs.alphaleonis.com/) library to provide I/O operations such as move, copy, and delete. These functions are available via the Cube.FileSystem.Io class. When you use the AlphaFS for I/O operations, describe the following statement at first.

```cs
// using Cube.FileSystem;
Io.Configure(new Cube.FileSystem.AlphaFS.IoController());
```

All I/O operations of the Cube.* projects also are performed via the Cube.FileSystem.Io class and therefore affected by its configuration.

The package is available for .NET Framework 3.5, 4.5, or later.
